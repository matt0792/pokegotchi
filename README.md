Pokégotchi is an idle, Pokémon themed web game based around collecting pokemon and watching them interact with each other. 
Still very much in development, and made primarily as practice for working with api's and using sass and js to create fun effects behaviors.
Uses pokeapi to dynamically retrieve and load data.
